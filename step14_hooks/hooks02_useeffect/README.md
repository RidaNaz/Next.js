# Effect Hooks
Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems.
This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.

## useEffect
useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
