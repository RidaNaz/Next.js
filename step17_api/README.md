# API (Application Programming Interface)

* An API serves as a **means of communication** between *two computers or pieces of software*. In a web application, an API facilitates communication between the client and the server.

* In Next.js 14, APIs are a core feature that allows your application to communicate with *external services* or *data sources* and *handle data logic* on the **server-side**.

## API Routes 

* An API route is a **URL** that directs incoming requests from the client to the appropriate server resource that will handle the requests.

* API routes in Next.js enable you to create **API endpoints** *as Node.js serverless functions*. These endpoints allow you to make *HTTPS requests* and also *communicate with a database*.

API Routes continue to work in the `pages/api` directory without any changes. However, they have been replaced by Route Handlers in the `app` directory.

## Route Handlers

you can create API endpoints using Route Handlers.

Route Handlers allow you to create **custom request handlers** for a given route using the Web **Request** and **Response** APIs.

``` typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {}
```

 If you previously used API routes to call an *external API from the client*, you can now use *Server Components* instead to securely fetch data.

### Benefits of using APIs in Next.js

There are a few cases where you might use an API to fetch data for your application:

- If you're using 3rd party services that provide an API.

- If you're fetching data from the client, you want to have an API layer that runs on the server to avoid exposing your database secrets to the client.






In Next.js, API routes are used for:

| Server-side rendering (SSR)| To pre-render pages with data fetched from an API. |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Data fetching | To fetch data from an external API or a custom API built with Next.js API routes. |
| Form handling | To handle form submissions and data mutations. |
| Authentication | To handle authentication and authorization. |
| Server-side logic | To run server-side logic, such as data processing or validation. |
| Webhooks | To handle incoming webhooks from external services. |
| Micro-apis | To build small, focused APIs that can be used by clients or other services. |
| Legacy API support | To support legacy APIs or integrate with existing APIs. |
| Caching | To cache data and improve performance. |
| Server-side rendering with Suspense (SWR) | To use SWR for caching and revalidation. |
