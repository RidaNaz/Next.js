# Authentication
Authentication verifies a user's identity. This happens when a user logs in, either with a username and password or through a service like Google.

### Authentication Strategies
Modern web applications commonly use several authentication strategies:
- OAuth / NextAuth.js
- [Credentials-based login](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication#implementing-authentication) (Email + Password)
- Passwordless / Token-based authentication
- Passkeys / WebAuthn (Use cryptographic credentials)

#### 1. [NextAuth.js](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/migrating-to-v5)
NextAuth.js is a complete authentication solution specifically designed for Next.js applications.

- Supports multiple providers: Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.
- Manages sessions with JWT or database sessions.
- Provides customization via callbacks, events, and pages.

#### 2. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login)
Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications.

- Supports a wide range of identity providers.
- Handles authentication, authorization, SSO, and more.
- Provides extensive security features and integrations.

#### 3. [Custom JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Authentication]()
JWT is a popular method for implementing stateless authentication.

- Tokens are issued upon login and sent with each request.
- Tokens can be verified on protected routes.
- Suitable for single-page applications (SPAs) and microservices.

#### 4. [Session-Based Authentication](/step21_auth/03_session-management/README.md)
This method involves storing user session information on the server and using cookies to manage sessions.

- Sessions are stored server-side.
- Cookies manage user sessions.
- Useful for applications requiring server-side rendering (SSR).

#### 5. Firebase Authentication
Firebase offers a comprehensive suite of authentication services.

- Supports email/password, phone, Google, Facebook, etc.
- Integrates with Firebase's other services like Firestore and Realtime Database.
- Easy to set up with Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations.

#### 6. OAuth with Passport.js
Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js.

- Supports various authentication strategies: Local, OAuth, OpenID, etc.
- Can be used with Next.js API routes.
- Highly customizable and extensible.

#### 7. Magic Links (Passwordless Authentication)
Magic links allow users to log in without a password, using a link sent to their email.

- Providers like Magic.link and Auth0 Passwordless offer this feature.
- Improves user experience by eliminating passwords.
- Secure and easy to implement.

#### 8. Social Logins
Social logins enable users to authenticate using their social media accounts.

- Can be implemented via providers like NextAuth.js, Auth0, Firebase, etc.
- Supports a wide range of social platforms.
- Simplifies the login process for users.
